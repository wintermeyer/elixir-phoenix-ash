## The absolute Essentials of Debugging Elixir Code

In this introductory guide, we're only scratching the surface of debugging in
Elixir, but I will introduce three vital tools that will be beneficial while
exploring the code examples in this book.

### dbg/2
indexterm:["dbg/2"]

Elixir version 1.14 introduced the powerful debugging tool `dbg(code \\ quote do
binding() end, options \\ [])`. It not only prints the passed value, returning
it simultaneously, but also outlines the code and location. Here's an example:

```elixir
iex(1)> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex(2)> dbg(name)
[iex:2: (file)]
name #=> "Elixir"

"Elixir"
iex(3)> dbg(IO.puts("Hello World!"))
Hello World!
[iex:3: (file)]
IO.puts("Hello World!") #=> :ok

:ok
```

NOTE: Beginners often find it odd that `dbg/2` and `IO.inspect/2` return the
value they print. However, once you start utilizing Pipes (which comes later in
this book), it becomes a natural part of maintaining uninterrupted code flow
while inspecting values in a pipe operation.

TIP: Have you recognized that `dbg/2` has an arity of 2 but we only use one
argument? That is possible because the second argument is optional (hence the
`options \\ []` part).

### IO.inspect/2
indexterm:["IO.inspect/2"]

The function `IO.inspect(item, opts \\ [])` is a staple in Elixir debugging.
Although it's less feature-rich than `dbg/2`, its usage remains widespread,
given its history and straightforward application. You can inject `IO.inspect/2`
into your code at any point, printing the value of an expression to your console
- perfect for verifying a variable's value or a function call's result.

For example:

```elixir
iex> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex> IO.inspect(name)
"Elixir"
"Elixir"
```

TIP: Feel free to always use `dbg/2` instead of `IO.inspect/2`. It does make
more sense. However, if you're working with older codebases, you'll likely
encounter `IO.inspect/2`.

### i/1
indexterm:["i/1"]

Finally, the IEx helper function `i/1` offers useful insights about any data
type or structure. Launch an IEx session with `iex` in your terminal, and then
call `i()` with any term to obtain information about it.

Here's an example:

```elixir
iex> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex> i(name)
Term
  "Elixir"
Data type
  BitString
Byte size
  6
Description
  This is a string: a UTF-8 encoded binary. It's printed surrounded by
  "double quotes" because all UTF-8 encoded code points in it are printable.
Raw representation
  <<69, 108, 105, 120, 105, 114>>
Reference modules
  String, :binary
Implemented protocols
  Collectable, IEx.Info, Inspect, List.Chars, String.Chars
```

This output elucidates that `"Hello, world!"` is a 13-byte BitString and
provides further details like the string's raw representation and the protocols
it implements.
