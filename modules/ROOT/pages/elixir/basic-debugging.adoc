## Debugging Essentials

In this introductory guide, we're only scratching the surface of debugging in
Elixir, but I'd like to introduce three vital tools that will be beneficial while
exploring the code examples in this book.

[[dbg-2]]
### dbg/2
indexterm:["dbg/2"]

Elixir version 1.18 includes the powerful debugging tool `dbg/2`. It not only prints the passed value, returning
it simultaneously, but also outlines the code and location. Here's an example:

```elixir
iex(1)> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex(2)> dbg(name)
[iex:2: (file)]
name #=> "Elixir"

"Elixir"
iex(3)> dbg(IO.puts("Hello World!"))
Hello World!
[iex:3: (file)]
IO.puts("Hello World!") #=> :ok

:ok
```

NOTE: Beginners often find it odd that `dbg/2` and `IO.inspect/2` return the
value they print. However, once you start utilizing Pipes (which we'll discuss in <<pipe-operator>>), it becomes a natural part of maintaining uninterrupted code flow
while inspecting values in a pipe operation.

NOTE: Have you recognized that `dbg/2` has an arity of 2 but we only use one
argument? That is possible because the second argument is optional (hence the
`options \\ []` part).

### IO.inspect/2
indexterm:["IO.inspect/2"]

The function `IO.inspect(item, opts \\ [])` is a staple in Elixir debugging.
Although it's less feature-rich than `dbg/2`, its usage remains widespread,
given its history and straightforward application. You can inject `IO.inspect/2`
into your code at any point, printing the value of an expression to your console
- perfect for verifying a variable's value or a function call's result.

For example:

```elixir
iex> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex> IO.inspect(name)
"Elixir"
"Elixir"
```

TIP: Feel free to always use <<dbg-2>> instead of `IO.inspect/2`. 
However, if you're working with older codebases, you'll likely
encounter `IO.inspect/2`.

### i/1
indexterm:["i/1"]

Finally, the IEx helper function `i/1` offers useful insights about any data
type or structure. Launch an IEx session with `iex` in your terminal, and then
call `i()` with any term to obtain information about it.

Here's an example:

```elixir
iex> name = "Elixir"
"Elixir"
iex> i(name)
Term
  "Elixir"
Data type
  BitString
Byte size
  6
Description
  This is a string: a UTF-8 encoded binary. It's printed surrounded by
  "double quotes" because all UTF-8 encoded code points in it are printable.
Raw representation
  <<69, 108, 105, 120, 105, 114>>
Reference modules
  String, :binary
Implemented protocols
  Collectable, IEx.Info, Inspect, List.Chars, String.Chars
```

This output elucidates that `"Hello, world!"` is a 13-byte BitString and
provides further details like the string's raw representation and the protocols
it implements.
