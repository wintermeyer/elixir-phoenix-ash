=== The Stream Module

=== Introduction
indexterm:[Stream]

The `Stream` module contains functions similar to the `Enum` module for mapping, filtering, grouping, sorting, reducing, and other operations. However, the key difference is that `Stream` operations are _lazy_. This means they only compute results when necessary, **potentially saving a lot of resources when dealing with large data sets or I/O operations.**

Consider this example of using `Stream` to multiply each element in a list by 2:

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Stream.map(list, fn x -> x * 2 end)
# => #Stream<[enum: [1, 2, 3, 4], funs: [#Function<45.122072036/1 in Stream.map/2>]]>
----

You might notice that the output is not a list but a `Stream`. To retrieve the final result, you will need to convert the stream back into a list:

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list
|> Stream.map(fn x -> x * 2 end)
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [2, 4, 6, 8]
----

The `Stream` module can be used with Elixir's pipe operator (`|>`) to create a sequence of transformations. The transformations only get executed when the stream is converted into a list or another enumerable.

This is how you would use `Stream` to multiply each element by 3 and then filter out odd numbers:

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list 
  |> Stream.map(fn x -> x * 3 end) 
  |> Stream.filter(fn x -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end)
  |> Enum.to_list()
# => [6, 12]
----

=== Commonly Used Stream Functions
indexterm:[Stream,Functions]

Stream offers a lot of useful functions, similar to Enum. All are listed at https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html[the official Stream documentation]. Here are some of the most commonly used functions to give you an idea of what's available.

[[stream-map]]
==== Stream.map/2
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,map]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#map/2[`Stream.map/2`] function is used to transform each element in an enumerable using a provided function. The result is a new Stream that can be evaluated later.

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list 
|> Stream.map(fn x -> x * 2 end) 
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [2, 4, 6, 8]
----

The `&1` shorthand can be used as follows:

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list 
|> Stream.map(&(&1 * 2))
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [2, 4, 6, 8]
----

More details can be found at the official link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#map/2[Elixir Stream.map/2 documentation].

[[stream-filter]]
==== Stream.filter/2
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,filter]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#filter/2[`Stream.filter/2`] function filters out elements based on a provided function, resulting in a new Stream.

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, nil, 2, nil, 3]
list 
|> Stream.filter(fn x -> x != nil end)
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [1, 2, 3]
----

Using the `&1` shorthand:

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, nil, 2, nil, 3]
list 
|> Stream.filter(&(&1 != nil))
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [1, 2, 3]
----

More details can be found at the official link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#filter/2[Elixir Stream.filter/2 documentation].

[[stream-reduce]]
==== Stream.reduce/2,3
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,reduce]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#reduce/3[`Stream.reduce/2,3`] function reduces an enumerable to a single value.

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Stream.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)
# => 10
----

NOTE: The use of `reduce/3` and it's accumulator is similar to the `fold` function in other languages. It can be tricky to use.

More details can be found at the official link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#reduce/2[Elixir Stream.reduce/2 documentation].

[[stream-take]]
==== Stream.take/2
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,take]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#take/2[`Stream.take/2`] function generates a new stream that takes the first `n` items from the original stream.

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list 
|> Stream.take(2)
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [1, 2]
----

More details can be found at the official link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#take/2[Elixir Stream.take/2 documentation].

[[stream-drop]]
==== Stream.drop/2
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,drop]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#drop/2[`Stream.drop/2`] function generates a new stream that drops the first `n` items from the original stream.

[source,elixir]
----
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list 
|> Stream.drop(2)
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [3, 4]
----

More details can be found at the official link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#drop/2[Elixir Stream.drop/2 documentation].

[[stream-concat]]
==== Stream.concat/1,2
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,concat]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#concat/2[`Stream.concat/1,2`] function generates a new stream that concatenates two streams or a stream of streams.

[source,elixir]
----
Stream.concat([1, 2], [3, 4])
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [1, 2, 3, 4]
----

More details can be found at the official link:https://hex

docs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#concat/2[Elixir Stream.concat/1,2 documentation].

[[stream-cycle]]
==== Stream.cycle/1
indexterm:[Stream,Functions,cycle]

The link:https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#cycle/1[`Stream.cycle/1`] function generates an infinite stream repeating the given enumerable.

[source,elixir]
----
Stream.cycle([1, 2])
|> Stream.take(5)
|> Enum.to_list()
# => [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
----
