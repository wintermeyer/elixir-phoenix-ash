=== The Match Operator `=` (Pattern Matching)
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Match Operator]
indexterm:[Pattern Matching]

In various programming languages, the equals sign (`=`) signifies assignment.
For example, `x = 5` generally reads as "Let `x` be equal to 5." Elixir, however,
assigns a slightly different role to the equals sign.

In Elixir, `=` acts as the _match operator. Trying to match the right side of
the expression with its left side. When we say `x = 5` in Elixir, we are essentially
telling the language, "Match `x` to the value 5." If `x` is unbound or has no
assigned value, Elixir will bind `x` to 5, making it behave similarly to an
assignment operator. But if `x` already holds a value, Elixir will attempt to rebind
it. Older versions of Elixir did throw an error in this case, but this
behavior was changed for a better user experience.

[source,elixir]
----
iex> x = 5
5
----

Elixir's pattern matching becomes even more robust with more complex data types like tuples or lists:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> {a, b, c} = {:hello, "world", 42}
{:hello, "world", 42}
iex> a
:hello
iex> b
"world"
iex> c
42
----

In the above snippet, Elixir matches variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to their respective values in the right-side tuple. Thus `a` equals `:hello`, `b` equals `"world"`, and `c` equals `42`.

While it might seem similar to destructuring in JavaScript or other languages, remember that Elixir aims to _match_ instead of simply assigning. If no match is found, Elixir throws an error:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> {d, e, f} = {:hi, "there", 23}
{:hi, "there", 23}
iex> {d, e} = {:hi, "there", 23}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:hi, "there", 23}
----

In the second command, a two-element pattern cannot match a three-element tuple, thus resulting in a `MatchError`.

To summarize, pattern matching in Elixir verifies whether a certain pattern matches your data. If it does, Elixir assigns values to variables based on that pattern.

NOTE: Pattern Matching is an incredibly powerful concept in Elixir, used in myriad ways. This is merely an introductionâ€”we will explore more examples throughout this book.

=== Functions
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Functions]

Pattern matching is pervasive in Elixir. It is used with functions too:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> defmodule Area do
...>   def circle(:exact, radius) do <1>
...>     3.14159265359 * radius * radius
...>   end
...>
...>   def circle(:normal, radius) do <2>
...>     3.14 * radius * radius
...>   end
...>
...>   def circle(radius) do <3>
...>     circle(:normal, radius)
...>   end
...> end

iex> Area.circle(:exact, 4)
50.26548245744
iex> Area.circle(:normal, 4)
50.24
iex> Area.circle(4)
50.24
----
<1> We define a `circle/2` function which matches if the first argument is the atom `:exact`.
<2> We define a `circle/2` function which matches if the first argument is the atom `:normal`.
<3> We define a `circle/1` function which calls the `circle/2` function with the `:normal` argument.

==== Functions with Guards
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Guards]

Guards add extra layers to pattern matching with functions. Full details can be
found at https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html. Let's look at a few examples.
Guards start with `when`:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> defmodule Law do
...>   def can_vote?(age) when is_integer(age) and age > 17 do <1>
...>     true
...>   end
...>
...>   def can_vote?(age) when is_integer(age) do <2>
...>     false
...>   end
...>
...>   def can_vote?(_age) do <3>
...>     raise ArgumentError, "age should be an integer"
...>   end
...> end

iex> Law.can_vote?(18)
true
iex> Law.can_vote?(16)
false
iex> Law.can_vote?("18")
** (ArgumentError) age should be an integer
----
<1> We define a `can_vote?/1` function with a guard clause that checks whether the age is an integer and greater than 17.
<2> We define a `can_vote?/1` function with a guard clause that checks whether the age is an integer.
<3> We define a `can_vote?/1` function to handle other cases.

=== Pattern Matching With Various Data Structures
indexterm:[Pattern Matching]

Pattern matching extends to various data structures in Elixir, including lists, maps, strings, and even function clauses. Let's see how this works.

==== Lists
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Lists]

Elixir provides a unique syntax for pattern matching the head and tail of a list. Let's consider the following examples:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> shopping_list = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"] <1>
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> [head | tail] = shopping_list <2>
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> head
"apple"
iex> tail
["orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> [a | b] = tail <3>
["orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> a
"orange"
iex> b
["banana", "pineapple"]
iex> [first_product, second_product | tail] = shopping_list <4>
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> first_product
"apple"
iex> second_product
"orange"
iex> tail
["banana", "pineapple"]
iex> [first_product | [second_product | tail]] = shopping_list <5>
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
----
<1> We match a list to the variable `shopping_list`.
<2> `[head | tail]` is the special syntax to match a head and tail of a given list.
<3> Here we match the head `a` and the tail `b` with `tail`.
<4> This is slightly more complex. We match the first and second product followed by a tail.
<5> This alternative syntax yields the same result but follows different logic. Choose the one you prefer.

If we know that a list has a specific number of elements, we can match it directly:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> shopping_list = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> [a, b, c, d] = shopping_list
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex> a
"apple"
iex> b
"orange"
iex> [e, f, g] = shopping_list <1>
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
----
<1> Just checking. You get an `MatchError` if Elixir can't match both sides.


==== Keyword Lists
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Keyword Lists]

In Elixir, **pattern matching on keyword lists is no longer recommended** due
to strict ordering and count requirements introduced in version 1.18.
While pattern matching was once possible, recent versions of Elixir make
it unreliable. Keyword lists are often used for optional arguments where
keys may be omitted, making pattern matching impractical.

Instead of pattern matching, access values directly by key using the [] syntax:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> list = [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3]
[a: 1, b: 2, c: 3]

iex> list[:a]
1

iex> list[:c]
3
----

#### Matching Inside Functions

Pattern matching with keyword lists is often used in function heads. Consider a system where you want to provide different messages to users based on their role. You could achieve this with pattern matching on keyword lists:

[source,elixir]
----
defmodule User do
  def greet(name, opts \\ []) <1>

  def greet(name, [role: "admin"]) do
    "Welcome, #{name}. You have admin privileges."
  end

  def greet(name, [role: "moderator"]) do
    "Welcome, #{name}. You can moderate content."
  end

  def greet(name, []) do
    "Welcome, #{name}."
  end
end

IO.puts User.greet("Alice") # Outputs: "Welcome, Alice."

IO.puts User.greet("Bob", role: "admin") # Outputs: "Welcome, Bob. You have admin privileges."

IO.puts User.greet("Carol", role: "moderator") # Outputs: "Welcome, Carol. You can moderate content."
----
<1> We define a `greet/2` function header with a default value for the second argument. The default value is an empty list `[]`.

In this example, we define different greetings based on user roles. When calling the `greet` function, we can optionally provide a `role`.
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Keyword Lists, Roles]


==== Maps
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Maps]

Matching a map in Elixir differs slightly from tuples or lists. We can match specific values we're interested in:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> product_prices = %{apple: 0.5, orange: 0.7, pineapple: 1}
%{apple: 0.5, orange: 0.7, pineapple: 1}
iex> %{orange: price} = product_prices <1>
%{apple: 0.5, orange: 0.7, pineapple: 1}
iex> price
0.7
iex> %{orange: price1, apple: price2} = product_prices <2>
%{apple: 0.5, orange: 0.7, pineapple: 1}
iex> price1
0.7
iex> price2
0.5
----
<1> Here we match just one value.
<2> We can match multiple values. It's not necessary to match the entire map.


==== Strings
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Strings]

Pattern matching with strings is best illustrated with a code snippet:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> user = "Stefan Wintermeyer"
"Stefan Wintermeyer"
iex> "Stefan " <> last_name = user
"Stefan Wintermeyer"
iex> last_name
"Wintermeyer"
----

NOTE: The left side of a `<>` operator in a match should always be a string. Otherwise, Elixir can't determine its size.

=== Wildcards
indexterm:[Pattern Matching, Wildcards]

Sometimes you want to pattern match something but you don't care about the
value. By using the `_` wildcard, either standalone or as a prefix to a variable
name, you signal to Elixir that there's no requirement for a binding to a
particular variable. Here are two examples:

[source,elixir]
----
iex(1)> cart = {"apple", "orange", "banana"}
{"apple", "orange", "banana"}
iex(2)> {first, _, _} = cart <1>
{"apple", "orange", "banana"}
iex(3)> IO.puts(first)
"apple"

iex(4)> cart2 = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex(5)> [head | _tail] = cart2 <2>
["apple", "orange", "banana", "pineapple"]
iex(6)> IO.puts(head)
"apple"
----
<1> We use wildcards `_` to ignore "orange" and "banana" in the `cart` tuple
while pattern matching the first item to `first`.
<2> With the list `cart2`, we pattern match the first item to `head`, ignoring
the rest of the list by prefixing `_` to `tail`.

NOTE: Using `{+_tail+}` instead of just `{+_+}` increases the readability of the code.
