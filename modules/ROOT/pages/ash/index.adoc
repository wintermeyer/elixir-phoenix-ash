= Ash Framework
Stefan Wintermeyer <sw@wintermeyer-consulting.de>

The Ash Framework's official site, link:https://ash-hq.org[ash-hq.org],
proclaims, *"Model your domain, derive the rest."* While this statement
resonates once you're familiar with Ash, it might not immediately clarify the
framework's essence for newcomers.

Believe me, investing time in understanding Ash is worthwhile. My background is
rooted in Ruby on Rails, and I transitioned to Phoenix for its speed and
scalability. However, Ash elevates the development process to an other level.

NOTE: This documentation covers Ash 3.0, which brings major improvements over
previous versions. If you're still using Ash 2.x, note that there are some
syntax changes and new features available in version 3.0.

Like the Phoenix Framework the Ash Framework has no shortage of
online documentation. But most of it is not beginner friendly
and very often a mystery in itself. This book and the
link:https://www.youtube.com/@elixir-phoenix-ash[@elixir-phoenix-ash YouTube channel]
is my endeavor to bridge this knowledge gap.

If a section doesn't resonate with you, skip it. You can circle back later
if needed. I recommend reading the book in order (start with xref:ash/resources/index.adoc[resources]),
but it's not required.

For feedback or inquiries about training (both onsite and remote), please reach out to me at sw@wintermeyer-consulting.de.

TIP: For official support, visit the Ash Framework community on https://elixirforum.com. The community is incredibly welcoming, so don't hesitate to pose any questions you might have. See you there!

## Getting Started

Igniter is the recommended way to get started with Ash. It provides a powerful code generator that handles all the setup and configuration for you, so you can focus on building your application rather than configuring dependencies.

To create a new Ash application, first install the Igniter archive:

```bash
$ mix archive.install hex igniter_new
```

Then create your application with Ash pre-installed:

```bash
$ mix igniter.new my_app --install ash
```

For a Phoenix application with Ash and PostgreSQL support:

```bash
$ mix igniter.new my_app --with phx.new --install ash,ash_postgres
```

You can also use the interactive web installer at https://ash-hq.org/#get-started to create a custom setup command tailored to your needs.

For more details and alternative approaches, see our xref:ash/ash-setup-guide.adoc[Ash Setup Guide].
