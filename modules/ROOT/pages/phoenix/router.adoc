# Router
Stefan Wintermeyer <sw@wintermeyer-consulting.de>

We have used https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html[Phoenix.Router]
plenty of times in xref:phoenix/index.adoc[Phoenix Basics], and you probably
already understand the basics. So this is just a small chapter with some useful
extra details.

IMPORTANT: Phoenix 1.8 includes verified routes with the `~p` sigil that provides compile-time
verification of routes. Instead of using the traditional helpers like `Routes.user_path(conn, :show, user)`,
you can now use `~p"/users/#{user}"` which is simpler and provides compile-time safety. Phoenix 1.8 also
introduces scopes for secure data access and authorization.

All code in this chapter will result from this base application:

[source,bash]
----
$ mix phx.new demo --no-ecto --no-dashboard <1>
$ cd demo
----
<1> We don't include the
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_dashboard/Phoenix.LiveDashboard.html[Phoenix.LiveDashboard]
(--no-dashboard) to keep our router setup tidy. Otherwise, there will be many
routes created just for the real-time performance monitoring dashboard, which
is not a topic in this chapter.

This results in a minimal router setup:

.lib/demo_web/router.ex
----
defmodule DemoWeb.Router do
  use DemoWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/", DemoWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end
end
----

At this stage, we will concentrate on the last function, which starts with
`scope "/"`.

[[mix-phx-routes]]
## Display existing routes

Running the command `mix phx.routes` will return a list of all defined routes.
In our vanilla demo system, this is the output:

[source,bash]
----
$ mix phx.routes
Compiling 13 files (.ex)
Generated demo app
page_path  GET  /                    DemoWeb.PageController :index <1>
websocket  WS   /socket/websocket    DemoWeb.UserSocket <2>
----
<1> This route is for a HTTP GET request for the root path - which gets matched
by `/` - of our application. It triggers the `:index` action in the
`DemoWeb.PageController` controller.
<2> No need to discuss `websockets` in this chapter. #I will remove that line
in following examples to clean up the output.#

NOTE: In more complex applications with a dashboard, the output of `mix
phx.routes` gets quite a bit longer. Then `mix phx.routes | grep
"_search-item_"` is a useful way of filtering the output.

[[router-params]]
## Params

There are many times when you will want to set a parameter, such as ID, in the
route. The following example will look at how we can set the parameter in the
router, and how we can access it in the controller.

.lib/demo_web/router.ex
[source,elixir]
----
[...]

scope "/", DemoWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :index
  get "/products/:id", ProductController, :show <1>
end

[...]
----
<1> We ask the router to match everything at that position to the parameter
`:id`.

.lib/demo_web/controllers/product_controller.ex
[source,elixir]
----
defmodule DemoWeb.ProductController do
  use DemoWeb, :controller

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do <1>
    conn
    |> assign(:id, id) <2>
    |> render("show.html")
  end
end
----
<1> We match the `id` in the params.
<2> In this example, we just add the id to the `assigns` map. Normally, we
would have fetched the product with that ID from the database and manipulated
the data before rendering the template.

.lib/demo_web/views/product_view.ex
[source,elixir]
----
defmodule DemoWeb.ProductView do
  use DemoWeb, :view
end
----

.lib/demo_web/templates/product/show.html.eex
[source,elixir]
----
<h1>ID: <%= @id %></h1> <1>
----
<1> Just a simple display.

If you open http://localhost:4000/products/1 in your browser, you'll see this
log entry in the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
[info] GET /products/1
[debug] Processing with DemoWeb.ProductController.show/2
  Parameters: %{"id" => "1"}
  Pipelines: [:browser]
[info] Sent 200 in 373µs
----

And here is the screenshot:

[[router-query-string]]
### Query String

To handle query strings, we do not need to add anything to the router. We just
need to make some small changes to the controller.

For example, if we add the query string "color=blue" to our product request
(http://localhost:4000/products/1?color=blue) and open this URL in the browser,
we can see from the log entry (shown below) that Phoenix has automatically
added `color` to the `params` (parameters) map.

[source,bash]
----
[info] GET /products/1
[debug] Processing with DemoWeb.ProductController.show/2
  Parameters: %{"color" => "blue", "id" => "1"} <1>
  Pipelines: [:browser]
[info] Sent 200 in 600µs
----
<1> Both parameters have been added to the `params` map.

Without adding anything to the router, the query string parameter `color` can
be accessed in the controller, but we need to make a few changes to the
controller:

.lib/demo_web/controllers/product_controller.ex
[source,elixir]
----
defmodule DemoWeb.ProductController do
  use DemoWeb, :controller

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id, "color" => color}) do <1>
    conn
    |> assign(:id, id)
    |> assign(:color, color) <2>
    |> render("show.html")
  end

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do <3>
    conn
    |> assign(:id, id)
    |> render("show.html")
  end
end
----
<1> This `show/2` function matches if there is an `:id` and a `:color` parameter.
<2> In addition to `:id` we have to assign `:color` too.
<3> This `show/2` function matches if there is only an `:id` parameter.

IMPORTANT: The order of the `show/2` functions in the controller is
significant. If we use the other order for this specific example the `%{"id" =>
id, "color" => color}` would never match because `%{"id" => id}` always matches
first if it's the first function.

Lastly we have to change the template:

.lib/demo_web/controllers/product_controller.ex
[source,elixir]
----
<h1>ID: <%= @id %></h1>

<%= if assigns[:color] do %> <1>
<p>Color: <%= @color %></p>
<% end %>
----
<1> Because we call this template from two different functions we have to take
care of the case when the color assigns hasn't taken place. Alternatively,
we could use a different template for each function.

image::router-params-color.png[http://localhost:4000/products/1?color=blue]

A view of the routes:

[source,bash]
----
$ mix phx.routes
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
   page_path  GET  /                                      DemoWeb.PageController :index
product_path  GET  /products/:id                          DemoWeb.ProductController :show
----

### Link with params

Assuming you'd like to link to the next product ID this would be the template:

.lib/demo_web/controllers/product_controller.ex
[source,elixir]
----
<h1>ID: <%= @id %></h1>

<%= if assigns[:color] do %> <1>
<p>Color: <%= @color %></p>
<% end %>

<%= link "Next", to: Routes.product_path(@conn, :show, String.to_integer(@id) + 1) %> <1>
----
<1> We use the `DemoWeb.ProductController :show` route and add the `id` to it.
To increase the current `@id` we have to call `String.to_integer/1` first.

### Link with query

And if you would like to link to the first product with the query
"color=orange", you would use this code:

.lib/demo_web/controllers/product_controller.ex
[source,elixir]
----
<h1>ID: <%= @id %></h1>

<%= if assigns[:color] do %> <1>
<p>Color: <%= @color %></p>
<% end %>

<%= link "First product in orange", to: Routes.product_path(@conn, :show, 1, color: "orange") %> <1>
----
<1> This returns a link to `http://localhost:4000/products/1?color=orange`

[[router-multilevel-paths]]
## Multilevel Paths

In the previous easy code examples, we always put the routes on the first level.
But of course, you can use paths with sublevels too. Here's an example:

.lib/demo_web/router.ex
[source,elixir]
----
[...]
scope "/", DemoWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/an-other-test/abc/def/", PageController, :index
end
[...]
----

No surprise here:

[source,bash]
----
$ mix phx.routes
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
page_path  GET  /an-other-test/abc/def    DemoWeb.PageController :index
----

[[router-wildcards]]
## Wildcards

You don't have to define the route precisely. You can use the `*` wildcard too.

.lib/demo_web/router.ex
[source,elixir]
----
[...]
scope "/", DemoWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/names/st*an", PageController, :index
end
[...]
----

This route matches `/names/stefan` and `/names/stephan`:

[source,bash]
----
[info] GET /names/stefan
[debug] Processing with DemoWeb.PageController.index/2
  Parameters: %{"an" => ["stefan"]} <1>
  Pipelines: [:browser]
[info] Sent 200 in 4ms
[info] GET /names/stephan
[debug] Processing with DemoWeb.PageController.index/2
  Parameters: %{"an" => ["stephan"]}
  Pipelines: [:browser]
[info] Sent 200 in 1ms
----
<1> The parameter is automatically named `an`, and it contains the whole match.
You can use that to do some interesting things.

## Misc

There's no need to replicate the official documentation in this chapter. By
now, you understand the concept of `Phoenix.Router`. You'll find solutions for
all the exceptional cases which are not handled in this chapter in the official
documentation at https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html
